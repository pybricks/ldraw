4. Enforcements

The single copyright holders are the sole entity responsible for
enforcements of their copyrights. For purposes of enforcement
LDraw.org considers the following good rules of thumb to determine
if a new file is not a Derivative Work. Anything else should be
considered a Derivative work and an attribution would be required.
If in doubt, contact the current LDraw SteerCo.

What is not considered a Derivative work?

  * Rendered images generated from the LDraw library. Rendering here
    covers any conversion of a 3D model file into a 2D image.

  * Model files containing references only (the source code for the
    part may NOT be included in any form) to parts in the official
    LDraw Parts Library at the time of their creation. Part files
    which are marked as unofficial at the time of creation may be
    included in full in the model file. If the sole or main purpose (as
    determined by the LDraw SteerCo in consultation with the potentially
    offending author and the LDraw community at large) of the model file
    is to include large numbers of unofficial parts then it WILL be
    considered a derivative work.

  * Alternative libraries of parts which LDraw.org does not own or
    enforce the copyright. If some or more of the parts in the library
    are converted from the LDraw Parts Library then they must be
    considered a Derivative Work.
